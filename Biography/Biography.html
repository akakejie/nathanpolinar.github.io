            <p>I was known as the most playful child in my class and neighborhood. I was full of energy and loved to have fun—sometimes so much that my parents asked me to calm down. But even though I was playful, I was also emotional and cried easily, whether from happiness or regret. My childhood was full of adventure, laughter, and sometimes tears.

                One unforgettable moment was when I got electrocuted after accidentally touching a generator while playing tag. Another time, I accidentally hit a friend in the eye with a clay ball, causing him to pass out. That night, I cried nonstop because I felt so guilty.
                
                At the age of three, I fell in love with basketball. Even though it was just a hobby, playing made me happy. I began to idolize my dad and grandpa when it came to basketball. To gain experience, I started joining leagues with my childhood friends. I would wake up early in the morning to practice by myself, eager to improve.
                
                I also loved to travel. One of my favorite memories was a summer trip to Bohol when I was in fifth grade. It was my first time riding an airplane. I had an amazing time at the beach, sightseeing, and even riding a motorbike.
                
                When I was eight years old, a friend introduced me to computer games like League of Legends, Crossfire, and Friv. I quickly became hooked and started going to internet cafés every day—even on school days. To make time for gaming, I finished my homework during school breaks so I could go straight to the café after class. Without realizing it, this was when I started developing an addiction to gaming.
                
                I also discovered a passion for dancing while in elementary school. I joined an organization that performed during special occasions at my school. One memorable moment was when I danced in a Christmas performance, wearing red overalls and a Santa hat.
                
                Despite being playful, mischievous, and sometimes a troublemaker, I always did well in school. I ranked second in my kindergarten class and was consistently an honor student in elementary school. My childhood was full of fun and mischief, but it also showed my determination, curiosity, and love for learning.</p>

            <p>As I grew older, I became less playful and more focused on school. I graduated from a special section in elementary school and went on to a science high school called Taguig Science High School. I was thrilled when I passed the entrance exam, but I had no idea how difficult high school would be.

                Even though it was tough, I made new friends who are still close to me today. During this time, I had my first crush. I liked a girl and gave her chocolates on Valentine's Day, but she ended up giving them to her friends instead. Even though it was disappointing, I didn’t let it bother me. I stayed focused on my studies and continued to get good grades.
                
                At 12 years old, I learned how to commute because my school was far from home. This gave me the chance to explore new places while traveling for school and fun. Around this time, my friends also introduced me to alcohol. I didn’t like it at first, but over time, that may have changed. One time, I got so drunk that when I got home at 11 PM, I was unsteady on my feet. But the moment I saw my mom, I quickly walked straight to avoid looking drunk in front of her.
                
                In eighth grade, I injured my right wrist while playing basketball. My hand was in a cast for six weeks, so I had to learn how to write, eat, and do other things using my left hand.
                
                When the COVID-19 pandemic started during my 10th-grade year, I was stuck at home and couldn’t go out. Because of this, I ate a lot and gained weight, reaching 75 kg. Feeling insecure, I started working out on our rooftop. With time and effort, I made progress and gained some muscle.
                
                During the pandemic, I also bought my first computer, which helped me with online classes and gaming. I met new people online, which helped me feel less lonely during the lockdown. It was also through a friend that I met my first and only ex-girlfriend.
                
                Even with the challenges of my teenage years, I always found ways to enjoy life. I spent time with friends, explored new places, and focused on my hobbies. Whether it was playing basketball, gaming, or just having fun, I made the most of every moment.</p>

            <p>I graduated with honors, but I soon faced a new challenge—college. Questions filled my mind: Which school should I go to? and What course should I pursue? I took the entrance exams for Ateneo de Manila University, the University of the Philippines, and the University of Santo Tomas and successfully passed all three. However, the more difficult decision was choosing which course to take.

                Initially, I considered pursuing a business-related degree since I graduated from the ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management) strand. However, in an unexpected turn, I chose to enroll at the University of the East and pursue a degree in Information Technology. My decision was influenced by my uncle, who had graduated from the same university with the same course.
                
                Accompanied by my mother and aunt, I went to the university to complete my enrollment. With that, all that remained was to wait for classes to begin. As the first day of college approached, I experienced a mix of emotions—anxiety, excitement, nervousness, anticipation, and even a bit of fear. The thought of meeting new professors and classmates brought both uncertainty and curiosity.
                
                My first day became especially memorable when I mistakenly entered the wrong classroom, ending up in a class for second-year students. It was an embarrassing moment, but one that would later become a funny story to tell. During my first month, I struggled to make friends, as I often sat in the back corner of the classroom—primarily because there was a nearby power socket where I could charge my phone. However, over time, some of my classmates reached out to me, and I gradually formed friendships. Among them were four students from Antipolo, who played a significant role in making my college life more enjoyable.
                
                College also introduced me to new experiences, including attending my first party at a club. It was a celebratory gathering with friends to mark the end of a semester. This tradition became something we looked forward to after the grueling finals week—a well-deserved reward for our hard work.
                
                Although my college journey is still ongoing, I have already created many memorable experiences. Despite enjoying my time in college, I remain committed to my studies, earning a spot as a college scholar. I successfully balance academic responsibilities with social activities, proving that dedication and enjoyment can go hand in hand.</p>
