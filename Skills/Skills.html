            <p>I was known as a <em>jack of all trades, master of none</em>. In other words, I could do many things, but I wasn’t particularly great at any of them. Sometimes, I felt like I wasn’t good enough because I couldn’t master one specific skill. But growing up on the streets taught me a lot. The challenges and experiences I faced shaped who I am today and helped me develop a wide range of skills. Instead of feeling discouraged, I learned to embrace my versatility and use it to my advantage.

                One of the most important skills I learned was adaptability. No matter what problems I faced, I found ways to adjust and overcome them. This ability helped me in many aspects of life, from school to social situations.
                
                I was also known for being sporty and as a sporty kid, I made it a point to try every sport I could, learning new skills along the way. In basketball, I became proficient in dribbling, shooting, and finishing. I also learned volleyball skills like receiving, serving, and setting. Swimming was another sport I explored, and I even mastered the backstroke and floating, which I found surprisingly relaxing. Sports not only kept me active but also taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance.
                
                Aside from sports, I also became skilled in gaming. It taught me quick reflexes, decision-making, communication, strategic thinking, and teamwork. I spent hours playing, sometimes sacrificing sleep just to get better. Competing against others pushed me to improve, and over time, I realized that gaming wasn’t just about entertainment—it was also about learning, adapting, and working with others.
                
                One of my more unusual skills is being able to stay awake for three days straight and still manage to go to class the next day. While it's not the healthiest habit, it's something I've learned to do when necessary. Over time, it taught me resilience and the importance of pushing through difficult situations, even when my body is exhausted. Although it's not something I would recommend, it's one of the ways I've learned to cope with the pressures and demands of daily life.</p>

            <p>As a curious person, I love exploring different activities that bring me joy. One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games, specifically on the computer. I mostly play popular games like <i>Valorant, League of Legends, and Roblox, among others</i>. I can grind for hours just to have fun, and that dedication has helped me develop valuable skills. I even peaked at <i>Immortal</i> in Valorant, the second-highest rank in the game. I also enjoy reading, especially webtoons and manga. The images help me visualize the story, making it more engaging. I usually read when I feel the need to, especially when I'm overwhelmed, as it helps me calm down. Another thing I love is sleeping—ironically, though, I rarely get enough of it. No matter how much I want to rest, I often find myself staying up late, either playing games, watching shows, or simply overthinking. Still, whenever I do get the chance to sleep in, it feels like the best thing in the world. I'm also a big fan of food—I love eating more than anything. I enjoy dining out with friends, family, or even by myself. Trying different restaurants excites me because I get to experience new flavors. No matter what mood I’m in, good food always makes everything better. I love watching movies and series, especially romance. I enjoy romance because I’m always yearning for it, and watching it makes me happy. I'm also a huge fan of Marvel movies—I could probably watch all of them in one sitting. Additionally, I love watching K-dramas because I sometimes find them relatable. At the end of the day, I find happiness in the little things—whether it’s gaming, food, or a good story, I always make the most of what I love.</p>

            <p>I have many interests that keep me busy and curious about the world. When I was a kid, I was interested in content creation because I admired a YouTuber named CongTV. I even started making vlogs but never posted them because I eventually felt it was silly to do so. I was also interested in photography for one simple reason—I thought it was cool. I even bought a DSLR camera to start capturing pictures, but I was too lazy to actually use it. At first, I was excited to take shots and experiment with different angles, but over time, my interest faded. I even watched YouTube tutorials on proper lighting and angles, but I never really put them into practice. I also became interested in playing instruments. I learned to play the guitar when I was young and even planned to buy an electric guitar. I’m not sure why I never went through with it. The fun part is that my friends and I once planned to start a band, but we were terrible at it. At some point, I became so interested in Esports that I started playing almost 24/7. I had been watching Esports since I was young, and it always fascinated me. I even told my mom that I wanted to become a pro player, but she said it was a waste of time. Up until now, I am still interested in Esports, and I still dream of going pro. When I discovered clubbing, I found DJs incredibly cool. I became interested in DJing, but I honestly have no idea where to start. I even started imagining song-to-song transitions in my head—that's how badly I want to try being a DJ. Looking back, I realize that my curiosity has led me to explore so many things, even if I didn’t stick with all of them. And while I may not have mastered any of these interests yet, I know that one day, I’ll find the passion that truly defines me.</p>
